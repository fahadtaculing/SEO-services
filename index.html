    <h2>Local Seo experience matter</h2>
    <h3>Northwestern Ontario Company</h3>
    <p>Business owners should consider the potential clients you have. Thunder Bayers are the residents and workers of the city. Let’s suppose you are a electrician. When they search for “electrician Thunder Bay”, the first company that comes up is yours. When people search for services on Google and other search engines, chances are they will choose you as their first choice. This is especially true for emergencies.</p>
    <P>You should also consider the surrounding communities and the Thunder Bay District. Your company might be the only one offering services in the region. This means that people searching for “carpenter in Nipigon” and “electrician in Red Rock”, may not find your Thunder Bay location. Your client base can be expanded by looking for people outside of your immediate vicinity. Thunder Bay is the largest city in Northwestern Ontario. Take advantage of it! You may even be able to branch out to customers as far as Red Lake.</P>
    <h3>SEO Thunder Bay</h3>
    <p>We know what it is like to be the largest city on hundreds of kilometres. We are locally-owned and run. Winnipeg is the closest major city to us! Thunder Bay SEO (Search Engine Optimization), is dependent on being able to keep your finger on the pulse in any given region. More on that later. We’re know what’s going on in T-Bay.</p> 
    <br>
    <h3>Superior Content</h3>
    <p>Google has one goal: to keep customers on their platform. This is done by making sure the top results in search are the best results. Simple, right?</p>
    <p>Google has many ways to decide what is best. Their algorithms are extremely complex. It all boils down to one idea: quality content is essential. You want people to read and see your content. People want to share content. This content should be relevant to both the local and industry. An article on how to install winter tires would be a good idea, if we go back to the hypothetical mechanic. Focus could be on how crucial traction is on the Shield’s treacherous roads – something that everyone in the Bay knows. You will enjoy our great content.</p>
    <p>Search engines cannot read as well as humans. It’s difficult for search engines to determine what content is of high quality without consulting another person. Without actually reading the paper, how can you tell if it is of high quality? Look at how many times it is cited! It’s guaranteed to be good if a paper is frequently cited, especially by SEO experts.</p>
    <p>Google uses the same principle to evaluate how often you link to your content. Google considers it a quality signal when other people in your industry or city are linking to your content. We will share the content that we create with respected sites, and they will link to it. Thias will make you an authority in Google’s eyes.</p>
    <h5>Do you want to rank higher than your competitors on Google?</h5>

        <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</h2>
        <p>You understand the importance of people being able to find your products and services. You won’t get any clients if they don’t know what you offer. Without clients, your income won’t be as good.</p>
        <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a technique for optimizing the content of your website so it ranks higher on search engines such as Google. Higher rankings mean more people will visit your website and use your services.</p>
        <p>We can help. SEO experts are specialists in search engine optimization. Our SEO specialists can help you analyze your content and create a strategy that will help you reach your revenue goals.</p>

        <h2>Why Companies Need SEO</h2>
        <p>For your website to be noticed, it is vital that you have good SEO. Without SEO, your site could be lost in a sea of thousands of other sites making it difficult to find potential clients. What if the websites of your competitors are optimized and yours isn’t?</p>
       <h3>Local SEO Services</h3>
